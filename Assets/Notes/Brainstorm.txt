Premise: 
    Space Station 13 Engineer
        - Tools to repair things (wrench, screwdriver, crowbar, wire cutters)
            - Minigame for each or just click in correct order
        - Multistep to fix each object
        - Different objects
            - Airlock
            - Button
            - Fire Alarm
            - Conveyor belt
                - Mining ship plot? (firefly style maybe)
            - Clock (funny, trivial)
            - Engine
            - Security Camera (plot of someone breaking things)
    Ship constantly breaking and getting more and more out of control
        - Have to keep track of different screws
        - Objects present error code and you check that in the manual
            - Very minigame driven? or is that scopey
        - Remembering whats on your belt or in your bag or in your pockets is part of the challenge/frustration (fun or not? check)

Core Loop:
    1. Alert something is broken (writing, voice acting, UI popup?)
    2. Travel to that object/find it (maybe trival if only 1 screen game)
    3. Open Manual to find how to fix (UI, pdf? probably UI because browser, no external download)
        - What should this look like
    4. Deconstruct -> Replace broken part -> Rebuild -> Test 
        - Instructions only tell how to deconstruct, do backwards to build?
        - Test sometimes fail and a different error code is presented
    
What is fun:
    Opening the manual and refrencing it while deconstructing is the fun part
        - Messing up a step should be entertaining... (Electrocute, Catch fire, Buzz)
    Keeping track of your inventory and the screws is also part of the fun (maybe)
    Hecticness of the ship and having multiple tasks pile up is fun
    Humor in the writing and priorities of tasks helps the fun
    Theres a high chance this isn't a fun concept... Welp thats what a jam is for I guess...
    A lot of the fun comes from hecticness and chaos, embrace that
        - The player should enjoy hunting for the lost screw or getting distracted
        - Maybe add some mechanics to help facilitate distraction (scopey?)

Want to learn:
    Unity Particles 
    Unity UI

Mechanics: (Ordered in best development order, i think...)
    Musts 
        + Player movement

        - Alert System (UI)
        - Manual (UI)
        - Game progresses linearly, questish story system (or should it be random, scopey if random)

        - Room Layout

        - Player toolbelt / Pockets
        - Player selected object/object in hand
        - Player changing what is selected (Test controls extensively, not SS13) (Maybe dial of tools in each inventory)

        - Player uses selected tool on object (Do good software design here, focus on the OOP)
            - Click/Right click on objects (tighten/loosen?)?
            - Interact with E?

        - Diverse objects (Focus on object OOP, make it easy to add many objects, the number here is proportional to how much game there is)
        
        - Music
        - Sound Effects

        - Player art (Ask for art help)
        - Object art 
        - Tool art 

        - Main Menu        
    Mays
        - Camera tracks player? (or static camera (easier))
        - Equiment can be tested
      * - Objects create particles if broken or working
        - Pause 

        - Ship art
      * - UI art (Kenny is the backup/early build option)

        - Distraction events
