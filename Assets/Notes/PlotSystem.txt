Dialog Manager -> controls the UI dialog box
Dialog -> Text to print on screen
Event Manager -> Holds what event is happening, handles player interact events, Randomly creates dialog while event runs
Event -> Contains dialog and the trigger to start the next events
    - Create one of these for each event 
    - Checks for current object to be fixed
    - List of steps (How to code, enum of actions? player sends action and check if its correct or not?)
        - Should each object keep its own steps and a state machine? I think this is better
Objects -> Has a state and can handle steps preformed on it
Game Manager -> Fires events periodicly
    - Some random, some scripted
        - Script after previous is fixed give some time
Interaction Manager -> Check what the player clicks
    - Working computer -> Open Manual
        - Design Manual!!! How is that going to work....?  I don't know UI
            - Text box popup, select what object to fix, List out steps and tools (tools in diff font color)
    - File Cabinet -> Computer repair manual (maybe later have you pick from a list of files)
    - Broken object/object -> Send tool interaction
